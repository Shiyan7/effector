# Contributing

We are open to and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By contributing to effector, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/effector/effector/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/effector/effector/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

## Development

Visit the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/effector/effector/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/effector.git
```

Another way is to use [gitpod](https://gitpod.io):

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/effector/effector

### Structure

- `docs` is a directory with .md files to build [effector.dev](https://effector.dev)
- `src` contains all source files of effector, effector-react, ...
- `packages` contains all files required to publish npm-packages
- `tasks` is a directory with scripts to build npm-packages
- `website` contains source files of [effector.dev](https://effector.dev)

### `yarn build`

This command uses [`./tasks`](https://github.com/effector/effector/tree/master/tasks) to generate package.json for each npm-package from `./packages` and build sources.
Rollup builds source files to `./npm` directory.

### README.md

To update Table of Contents use this command:

```sh
npx doctoc README.md
```

### Tests

Just use `yarn test` and `yarn test:watch`.

### Type tests

`yarn test --testPathPattern='types'` to run types tests, `yarn test --testPathPattern='types' -u` to update their inline snapshots. Public types are always placed in `packages/<library name>/*.d.ts`, for example, [here are public typings for effector](https://github.com/effector/effector/blob/master/packages/effector/index.d.ts)

Type tests are placed in [src/types/\_\_tests\_\_/\<package-name>/\*.test.js](https://github.com/effector/effector/tree/master/src/types/__tests__)

To add new type test, put that code to any file with type tests:

```js
test('test name', () => {
  // any code here

  expect(typecheck).toMatchInlineSnapshot()
})
```

and run type tests. Inline snapshot will be filled with type errors (if any) for given code for both typescript and flow type systems.

Note that your code must be compatible with both, except `.ts` and `.tsx` test files.

### New Features

Please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work.
We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

Before opening a feature request, please read the [exists ideas discussions](https://github.com/effector/effector/discussions/categories/ideas) to make sure your feature hasn't already requested.

### Publishing

1. Run `yarn releaser:prepare` for **each updated package** and answer the survey
2. Manually update changelog files, if needed. They are located at `tools/releaser/releaseState/changelogs`. You also can run `yarn releaser:prepare` to update changes.
3. If everything is as you want it to be, run `yarn releaser:apply` - it will update `nextVersions` config and `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Run `yarn build`. Check `npm/{packageName}` if needed.
5. Commit the result to the `master` branch - updates will be automatically published to the `npm` and `changelog.effector.dev`.
6. If packages are published successfuly - create corresponding GitHub Releases for each update.

## Submitting Changes

- Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/effector/effector/issues).
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based on the `master` branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
- Please, write [a good commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/), explaining why not how.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
